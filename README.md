Library for determining various characteristics about mathematical graphs.
Given the adjacency matrix for a graph as input, this library has functions to:
* Determine number of vertices
* Determine number of edges
* Determine the total degree of the graph
* Determine the max degree of the graph

Note that several test input adjacency matrices are located in the test_input_graphs
directory. There, you will find several popular graphs.
